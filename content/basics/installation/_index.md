Forged Thoughts can be easily installed as a **Rust** subcommand.

First, if you do not have already, install **Rust**` and **cargo** on your system by following the easy steps [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

After that you can install Forged Thoughts by typing the following command in your terminal:

```shell
cargo install ftc
```

This installs [ftc](https://crates.io/crates/ftc) the compiler and renderer front-end for Forged Thoughts. You can now invoke *ftc* in your terminal.
