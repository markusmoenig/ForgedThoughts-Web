Forged Thoughts can be easily installed as a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) subcommand.

First, if you do not have already, install *Rust* and *cargo* on your system by following the easy steps [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

After that you can install Forged Thoughts by typing the following command in your terminal:

```shell
cargo install ftc
```

This installs [ftc](https://crates.io/crates/ftc), the compiler and renderer front-end for Forged Thoughts. You can now invoke *ftc* in your terminal.

By default *ftc* will load, compile and render the *main.ft* file located in the current directory. For further usage information please see the next chapter.
